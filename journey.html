                        <p>The journey in the development sector started back in 2005 from an organization called Spiny
                            Babbler.
                            Implementing community development projects, working closely with the community was the
                            embarking
                            moment in this sector. This initial experience was transformative, as it deepened his
                            understanding
                            of the challenges communities face and highlighted the importance of participatory
                            approaches in
                            ensuring sustainable change. The journey continued till the end of 2011 in different
                            capacities in
                            different Non-Governmental Organizations in Nepal and university in Finland as a researcher.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following his tenure at Spiny Babbler, he continued to expand his knowledge and impact in the
                            development sector until the end of 2010. He then took on various roles within different
                            non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Nepal, where he engaged in project management,
                            administration, monitoring and evaluation, capacity building, and community outreach. Each
                            position
                            allowed him to refine his skills and adapt to each organization's unique contexts and
                            challenges.
                            These projects involved working directly with local communities to identify their needs and
                            empower
                            them to drive their own development.</p>
                        <p>Bibhuti collaborated closely with various stakeholders throughout this journey, including
                            government
                            counterparts, bilateral organizations, Universities, and donors. These partnerships were
                            essential
                            in fostering a multifaceted approach to development, as they facilitated resource sharing
                            and
                            strengthened the overall impact of initiatives. By working together, our collective
                            expertise
                            ensured that the projects were aligned with the broader goals of the MDG (2015) and the SDG
                            (2030).

                        <h2>World of Evaluation and Research</h2>
                        <p>In 2012, Bibhuti had the incredible opportunity to work alongside Dr. Dil Prasad Shrestha, a
                            highly respected expert in monitoring and evaluation (M&E). During this time, Bibhuti
                            engaged in various assignments that allowed him to apply theoretical knowledge in practical
                            settings. Under Dr. Shrestha's mentorship, he received invaluable guidance that helped him
                            navigate the complexities of evaluation methodologies and frameworks. </p>
                        <p>Dr. Dil's constant support boosted Bibhuti's confidence and encouraged him to think
                            critically and creatively about qualitative and quantitative analysis and interpretation. As
                            Bibhuti delved deeper into different projects, he gained hands-on experience designing
                            evaluation frameworks, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting findings to
                            stakeholders. </p>
                        <p> This collaborative experience was enlightening and immensely fulfilling, as it allowed him
                            to contribute to meaningful research and evaluation efforts. The milestones Bibhuti achieved
                            during this period significantly enhanced his understanding of the evaluation landscape and
                            solidified his passion for research. Ultimately, this journey set the stage for Bibhuti's
                            continued growth and exploration in evaluation and research. </p>

                        <p>Since then, Bibhuti has embarked on a transformative journey towards personal and
                            professional development. Recognizing the importance of continuous growth, he has actively
                            sought various opportunities to acquire new skills, ranging from technical abilities to
                            interpersonal communication. Along the way, he has gained profound insights into his field
                            and a deeper understanding of himself and his capabilities..</p>
                        <p>Each experience he has gained has played a crucial role in shaping his development. These
                            experiences have built his knowledge base and strengthened his resilience, allowing him to
                            adapt more effectively to the challenges that arise in his career and personal life. As
                            Bibhuti navigates this dynamic landscape, he does so with a renewed sense of purpose and
