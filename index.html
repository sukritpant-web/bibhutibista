                <p>The journey in the development sector started back in 2005 from an organization called Spiny Babbler. Implementing community development projects, working closely with the community was the embarking moment in this sector. This initial experience was transformative, as it deepened his understanding of the challenges communities face and highlighted the importance of participatory approaches in ensuring sustainable change. The journey continued till the end of 2011 in different capacities in different Non-Governmental Organizations in Nepal and university in Finland as a researcher. </p>
                <p>Following my tenure at Spiny Babbler, he continued to expand his knowledge and impact in the development sector until the end of 2010. He then took on various roles within different non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Nepal, where he engaged in project management, administration, monitoring and evaluation, capacity building, and community outreach. Each position allowed him to refine his skills and adapt to each organization's unique contexts and challenges. These projects involved working directly with local communities to identify their needs and empower them to drive their own development.</p>
                <p>Bibhuti collaborated closely with various stakeholders throughout this journey, including government counterparts, bilateral organizations, Universities, and donors. These partnerships were essential in fostering a multifaceted approach to development, as they facilitated resource sharing and strengthened the overall impact of initiatives. By working together, our collective expertise ensured that the projects were aligned with the broader goals of the MDG (2015) and the SDG (2030). </p>
