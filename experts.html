                            sensitivity that makes her a valuable asset to the team. With experience rooted in
                            gender-based violence programming and close collaboration with child protection actors, she
                            demonstrates deep understanding of children’s rights, safeguarding principles, PSEA, and
                            safe referral pathways. Her research background—including a feminist qualitative study on
                            economic violence against Indigenous women—shows her ability to design and manage rigorous,
                            intersectional studies grounded in human rights analysis. Sutapa’s proven ability to work

                            Master’s in Human Rights in Europe, ensure that she produces high-quality, well-structured
                            reports. Importantly, her consistent adherence to ethical research standards and commitment
                            to confidentiality, informed consent, and do-no-harm make her particularly well suited to
