                            involve using a mixed-methods approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative data to
                            provide a more holistic understanding. Alternatively, focus exclusively on quantitative
                            methods to analyze numerical data and identify patterns or trends. Likewise, conduct
                            qualitative research, emphasising personal narratives and individual experiences to gain
                            deeper insights into complex issues.</p>
